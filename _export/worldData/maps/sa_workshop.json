Then to the right, there are circular workbenches with countless little projects littering the tops. Most of which, are wooden.\n\nAnd straight ahead, lies the forge, beside a huge board stuck to the wall with requests from people in and around the Academy, for things of all kinds to be made by the smith that lives here."

The leaders signed peace treaties, afraid of being struck again by something so big.\n\nOnly until a year later did they find out that the hammer belonged to a giant from the North, Ramril Ossenwad. The clumsy behemoth had tossed his hammer in the wrong direction during his coming of age ceremony...\n\nUnfortunately for those who'd begun worshiping the hammer, Ramril claimed his possession back and went on his merry way. Until he slipped and fell down a cliff, the hammer going off somewhere else again...\n\nThe story goes on and on and on, Ramril travelling in search of his hammer, and then finding it for mere moments before losing it again.\n\nThe actual tool wore down and somehow became smaller over time, but now that Ramril's dead, it's being put to use by the workshop."
